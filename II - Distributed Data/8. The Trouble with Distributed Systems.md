Assuming that anything that **could possibly go wrong will go wrong** is a reasonable assumption, which allows us to **prevent issues before they happen**.

## Faults and Partial Failures

**Determinism** - the **same operation** always produces the **same result**.

**Single machine software** is usually **deterministic**. It either **works as expected** for given input **or it doesn't work** (also, as expected) for given input.

**Distributed systems** are prone to **partial failures**.

**Partial failure** - when **part of the system is broken**, while other parts are working just fine. Usually partial failures are **non-deterministic**.

### Cloud Computing and Supercomputing

Traditional **enterprise datacenters** are something **between** **supercomputing** and **cloud-computing**.

**Supercomputing** - computing on **machine with thousands of CPUs** which are used for high computations. Usually failure here means **complete system failure**.

**Cloud-computing** - computing based on **multi-tenant datacenters** having ordinary computers. **Partial failures** happen here.

Internet services are different from supercomputing:
- service is **not acceptable to be offline** (for instance, repair);
- for cloud services **no expensive special hardware** is affordable;
- datacenters **use IP Ethernet network** for communication, not specialized topologies;
- in big systems there's **always something broken**, though **system still has to continue** its operation;
- system tolerating failed nodes is **simple for maintenance** - it is possible to do a **rolling upgrade**, installing **security patches** on nodes, **restart node** while system still serve user requests;
- distributed systems may have their **nodes scattered across the world**, while supercomputers expect close distance between each other.

In distributed systems **suspicion, pessimism, paranoia pay off**. We should **consider all faulty scenarios**, even unlikely ones. We need to **build reliable system from unreliable components**.

## Unreliable Networks

See [[Async networks]].

![[Sync vs Async nets]]

## Unreliable Clocks

See [[Clocks]].

### Relying on Synchronized clocks

**Unsync clocks** won't cause dramatic crash. Instead it will be **subtle data loss**. Software needs to be **prepared for incorrect clocks**.

If **precise clocks are required** for the code, it is necessary to have the **clocks monitoring** on nodes in cluster and **once clock is too far away**, declare the **node dead** and remove from the cluster.
